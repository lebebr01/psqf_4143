    "You will be asked to complete a short survey on ICON that asks questions about the output generated below. Furthermore, there are additional questions to consider sprinkled throughout the notebook below, these do not need to be explicitly answered, but can provide a bit of a guide to thinking and interpreting the following statistical output. \n",

    "This first code cell needs to be executed (\"Run\") everytime this notebook is opened. For example, if you stop working on this activity and come back to the activity, this first code cell will need to be executed again to load the data, even though output may still show up from the prior time you worked on the activity. \n",

The data contain 19,405 rows and 28 columns about tornados from around the United States between 2007 and 2022. A data description for each column in the data is shown below ([see the Tidy Tuesday page for more information](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-08-09))\n",
