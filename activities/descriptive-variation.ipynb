Some examples may include, graduate vs not-graduated, watched a tv show vs did not watch a tv show, took a medicine vs did not take medicine, and many other options. These types of variables can sometimes be represented as text, but are often represented as numbers, most commonly where one group is represented with a 0 and the other with a 1.
