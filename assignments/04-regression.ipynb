{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ## Assignment 4\n","\n"," This assignment is aimed to give you some practice using Jupyter Notebooks, R, and interpretting statistical output using real-world data. The notebook below will be used to generate the statistical output and you will also write up answers to specific questions related to the statistical output. The assignment will be guided and much of the R code will be provided for you, but specific aspects of the R code you will be asked to interact with and ultimately make a decision about appropriate values to include. The notebook should be run from the first code cell in sequential order, this means that you must run the beginning cells in order to be able to have access to the R packages needed for the assignment and that the data are read in appropriately.\n","\n"," You may work in groups of up to 3 to complete the assignment.
