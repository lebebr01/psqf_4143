    "   ## Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   This assignment is aimed to give you some practice using Jupyter Notebooks, R, and interpretting statistical output using real-world data. The notebook below will be used to generate the statistical output and you will also write up answers to specific questions related to the statistical output. The assignment will be guided and much of the R code will be provided for you, but specific aspects of the R code you will be asked to interact with and ultimately make a decision about appropriate values to include. The notebook should be run from the first code cell in sequential order, this means that you must run the beginning cells in order to be able to have access to the R packages needed for the assignment and that the data are read in appropriately.\n",

    "   You may work in groups of up to 3 to complete the assignment. In these situations, please turn in one assignment in ICON with all group members names on the submission.\n",

    "  ## Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this assignment are about board games. The data are board games published (i.e., released) between 2010 and 2016 that can be played with fewer than 5 players and have a maximum number of 8 players. The data are also for games that tend to be completed in less than 120 minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "   The data were part of a [tidy tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-12) example and came from the [Board Game Geek](http://boardgamegeek.com/) database. The database crowd sources game ratings and contains more than 90,000 games. The following subsetted version contains data on 3,664 games of those games. The following are the attributes in the data used for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   + **game_id**: The unique ID of the game\n",
    "   + **max_players**: The maximum number of players for the game\n",
    "   + **min_playtime**: Minimum playtime for the game\n",
    "   + **min_age**: Minimum age for playing the game\n",
    "   + **min_players**: Minimum number of players needed to play the game\n",
    "   + **name**: Name of the game\n",
    "   + **playing_time**: Playing time of the game\n",
    "   + **year_published**: Year the game was published (i.e., able to be purchased or released)\n",
    "   + **average_rating**: Average rating of the game from the crowd-source database.\n",
    "   + **play_time_groups**: The average play time split into 3 groups, less than 30 minutes, between 30 and 60 minutes, greater than 60 minutes.\n",
    "   + **category_group**: The primary category of the game, as 6 groups, Abstract Strategy, Adventure, Bluffing, Card Game, Dice Game, or Other category.\n",
