    "   ## Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   This assignment is aimed to give you some practice using Jupyter Notebooks, R, and interpretting statistical output using real-world data. The notebook below will be used to generate the statistical output and you will also write up answers to specific questions related to the statistical output. The assignment will be guided and much of the R code will be provided for you, but specific aspects of the R code you will be asked to interact with and ultimately make a decision about appropriate values to include. The notebook should be run from the first code cell in sequential order, this means that you must run the beginning cells in order to be able to have access to the R packages needed for the assignment and that the data are read in appropriately.\n",

    "   You may work in groups of up to 3 to complete the assignment. In these situations, please turn in one assignment in ICON with all group members names on the submission.\n",

    "  ## Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "  These data are from a bike share program in Minneapolis Minnesota called [Nice Ride](https://www.niceridemn.com/). These programs have become popular in larger metros and allow individuals to rent a bike for a short period of time at specified stations. Users return the bikes to the same station or another station in a different part of the city and are charged per ride based on how long the bike was rented for. The pricing structure for this program can be found here: https://www.niceridemn.com/pricing. The gist of the pricing structure is that users can pay for each individual ride where every 30 minutes of bike renting time costs 2 dollars or you can buy a day pass for unlimited 30 minute rides for 24 hours. There is also an option for locals to buy an annual membership which comes with unlimited 60 minute rides for an entire year. Nice Ride also offers electric bicycles for an extra 15 cents per minute of the ride. Also, if you are interested, a real time map of the bike stations and bikes that are available can be seen here: https://member.niceridemn.com/map/.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The data was downloaded directly from the Nice Ride website and contain individual trip data for the month of June 2020. Nice Ride releases trips that are longer than 60 seconds and some additional processing was done to remove rides that were longer than 4 hours (240 minutes). The data contain the following variables, note the variable name is in bold with a short description of what the variable represents:\n",
    "   + **ride_id**: The unique ID of the ride\n",
    "   + **rideable_type**: The type of bike rented, \"docked_bike\" is the bike from a station; \"electric_bike\" is a bike that floats around and does not need to start or return from a station.\n",
    "   + **started_at**: Date and time the bike ride started.\n",
    "   + **ended_at**: Date and time the bike ride ended.\n",
    "   + **member_casual**: The type of rental user, \"casual\" is a per bike rental with no subscription, \"member\" is an annual Nice Ride subscriber\n",
    "   + **tripduration_seconds**: The length the bike was rented in seconds.\n",
    "   + **tripduration_minutes**: The length the bike was rented in minutes, i.e. the variable tripduration / 60.  \n",
    "   + **hour**: The hour the bike was rented.\n",
    "   + **morning**: If the ride was during the morning, defined as between 5 am and 11:59 am. \n",
    "   + **evening**: If the ride was during the evening, defined as between 4 pm and 10:59 pm. \n",
