    "   ## Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   This assignment is aimed to give you some practice using Jupyter Notebooks, R, and interpretting statistical output using real-world data. The notebook below will be used to generate the statistical output. The assignment will be guided and much of the R code will be provided for you, but specific aspects of the R code you will be asked to interact with and ultimately make a decision about appropriate values to include. The notebook should be run from the first code cell in sequential order, this means that you must run the beginning cells in order to be able to have access to the R packages needed for the assignment and that the data are read in appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Upon completion of generating the statistical code, you will be asked to submit answers to questions on a Microsoft Form quiz. These questions will be focused on interpreting the statistical output generated from this notebook. The link to this Microsoft Form quiz will be given in the ICON assignment submission. *Note: you do not need to upload anything to ICON*.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You may work in groups of up to 3 to complete the assignment. In these situations, please turn in one assignment in ICON with all group members names on the submission.\n",
