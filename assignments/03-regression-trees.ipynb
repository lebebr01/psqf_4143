    " ## Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    " This assignment is aimed to give you some practice using Jupyter Notebooks, R, and interpretting statistical output using real-world data. The notebook below will be used to generate the statistical output and you will also write up answers to specific questions related to the statistical output. The assignment will be guided and much of the R code will be provided for you, but specific aspects of the R code you will be asked to interact with and ultimately make a decision about appropriate values to include. The notebook should be run from the first code cell in sequential order, this means that you must run the beginning cells in order to be able to have access to the R packages needed for the assignment and that the data are read in appropriately.\n",

    " You may work in groups of up to 3 to complete the assignment. In these situations, please turn in one assignment in ICON with all group members names on the submission.\n",

    " ## Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    " These data are housing data from Ames, Iowa for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and through July 2010. The data come from an R package names, `AmesHousing`, and contains a variety of variables about the houses that were sold during these years. The data have been simplified for this assignment by focusing on single family houses (i.e. omitting condos, multifamily homes, apartments, etc) and a subset of the attributes (i.e. variables) from the full data were retained. These are described in some detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    " + **SalePrice**: The home sale price is US dollars.\n",
    " + **price_above_60**: Whether the home sold above the 60th percentile, TRUE = above 60th percentile, FALSE = below 60th percentile\n",
    " + **Yr_Sold**: Year the home was sold\n",
    " + **Mo_Sold**: Month the home was sold, represented as number, e.g. 1 = January\n",
    " + **Neighborhood**: Name of the neighborhood in Ames\n",
    " + **Lot_Config**: The configuration of the lot, whether it is a corner lot, on a cul-de-sac, inside lot, etc.\n",
    " + **Lot_Area**: Square footage of the lot the house resides on.\n",
    " + **Overall_Qual**: The overall quality of the home with respect to material and finish: 0 = worst quality, 10 = best quality\n",
    " + **Overall_Cond**: The overall condition of the home: 0 = worst condition, 10 = best condition.\n",
    " + **Year_Built**: The year the home was built.\n",
    " + **Gr_Liv_Area**: Total square feet of home that is above ground, does not include basement square footage.\n",
    " + **Bedroom_AbvGr**: Number of bedrooms above ground, does not include any bedrooms in the basement.\n",
    " + **num_baths**: Number of bathrooms.\n",
    " + **Fireplaces**: Number of fireplaces\n",
    " + **Garage_Cars**: Number of cars the garage can hold\n",
