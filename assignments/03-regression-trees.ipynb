    " ## Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    " This assignment is aimed to give you some practice using Jupyter Notebooks, R, and interpretting statistical output using real-world data. The notebook below will be used to generate the statistical output and you will also write up answers to specific questions related to the statistical output. The assignment will be guided and much of the R code will be provided for you, but specific aspects of the R code you will be asked to interact with and ultimately make a decision about appropriate values to include. The notebook should be run from the first code cell in sequential order, this means that you must run the beginning cells in order to be able to have access to the R packages needed for the assignment and that the data are read in appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    " You may work in groups of up to 3 to complete the assignment. In these situations, please turn in one assignment in ICON with all group members included on the submission.\n",

    "## Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are medical charge data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). These data contain information on the medical charges plus individual demographic information about the person associated with those charges. The goal of this analysis will be to try to use the demographic information to try to predict the medical charges for that individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **age**: The age of the individual.\n",
    "+ **sex**: The sex of the individual at birth, male or female. \n",
    "+ **bmi**: The body mass index of the individual\n",
    "+ **children**: A count of the number of children the individual has.\n",
    "+ **smoker**: Whether the individual smokes or not, yes = smokes, no = does not smoke.\n",
    "+ **region**: The region of the country the person is located, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.\n",
    "+ **charges**: The medical insurance charges.\n",

    "Furthermore, please reach out if there are specific questions regarding the code below. I do not want the code to be a barrier, but it does allow us to do more interesting things and work with more interesting data. We will provide any support to fix any errors you may encounter with the code. "
