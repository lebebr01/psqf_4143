However, this is usually not where the journey stops, instead additional analyses are often performed to learn more about the average trends seen in the data. These can often be split into two broad categories,\n","\n","  1. Descriptive Statistics\n","  2. Inferential Statistics\n","\n","  **Descriptive Statistics** help to describe the data and are particularly useful to give a single numeric summary for a single variable. We will explore this idea more fully in this section.\n","  **Inferential Statistics** help us to make broader statements from the data we have to the larger group of interest, commonly referred to as the population. More details on these steps later in the course."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  ## Setup\n","\n","  We are going to use some real data about higher education institutions from the college scorecard (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) to explore the types of conclusions we can make from the data.

The R function to read in the data is `read_csv()`. Function arguments are passed within the parentheses and for the `read_csv()` function the first argument is the path to the data. The data for this example are posted on GitHub in a comma separated file. This means the data is stored in a text format and each variable (i.e. column in the data) is separated by a comma. This is a common format data is stored.\n","\n","  The data is stored to an object named `college_score`. In R (and other statistical programming languages), it is common to use objects to store results to use later. In this instance, we would like to read in the data and store it to use it later. For example, we will likely want to explore the data visually to see if we can extract some trends from the data. The assignment to an object in R is done with the `<-` assignment operator. Finally, there is one additional argument, `guess_max` which helps to ensure that the data are read in appropriately. More on this later."],"metadata":{}},{"source":["college_score <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lebebr01/statthink/master/data-raw/College-scorecard-4143.csv\", guess_max = 10000)\n","head(college_score)\n",""],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  ## Functions to columns of data\n","\n","  Data are often stored in a tabular format where the rows of the data are the units and the columns in a data frame are the varaibles. This is shown in the college scorecard data above where the rows of the data are specific institutions of higher education and the columns represent various attributes about those higher education institutions. This is a common structure to store data where each row represents a unique unit or measurement occasion for longitudinal data.\n","\n","  In the data visualization units, we accessed columns of data to view the distribution of the particular variable. For example, we explore histograms of admission rate. Instead of visualizing the data, now we will apply functions to these columns to calculate statistics of interest.

The median attempts to provide a single number summary for the center of the distribution. It is a robust statistic, but likely isn't the most popular statistic to provide a location for the center of a distribution. The mean is often more commonly used as a measure of the center of a distribution. Part of this is due to the usage of the mean in common statistical methods and the mean also uses the values of all the data in the calculation. The median only considers the values of the middle score or scores, therefore this statistic is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean. I like to look at both statistics and this can provide some insight into the distribution of interest.
