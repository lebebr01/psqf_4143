    "In general, symmetric distributions are preferred over skewed distributions and some models make an assumption of normality, a special type of symmetric distribution. One way to help make a skewed distribution more symmetric is to transform the data. For a positively skewed distribution, such as income, rent, salary, etc, a log transformation is a common transformation that is used by econometricians and is a meaningful transformation. The largest downside of the transformation is that the original metric is lost and the analysis is done on the transformed metric. The log transformation identified above is often referred to as a non-linear transformation such that it alters values differently based on where these are on the scale. For example, the log transformation will minimize gaps that are higher up on the scale and spread out gaps in small values, this is why this type of transformation is common for right or positively skewed data. Below is a figure applying the log transformation to the salary attribute.\n"

    "  ## Explore relationships between two quantitative attributes\n",
    "  So far, the course has focused on exploring relationships between a quantitative and various qualitative (i.e. categorical or grouping) attributes. It is also common to want to explore relationships between two quantitative attributes. One way to visualize this type of relationship is with a scatterplot and this can be done with the `gf_point()` function. Similar to other multivariate figures, this function takes a formula as the input where the attribute of interest (log of salary here) is placed on the left hand side of the equation and the second attribute is placed on the right hand side of the equation. Below, the equation `log(Salary) ~ HmRun` means that the log salary is the attribute of interest (placed on the y-axis) is going to be plotted in conjunction with the number of home runs the player hit (placed on the x-axis). Let's look at the figure."

A correlation of -1 means the two attributes are inversely related, more specifically this means that as one goes up the other will tend to decrease.

    " ## Decision Tree - Regression Tree\n",
    " Another way to explore the relationship between two quantitative attributes is through the fitting a regression tree. A regression tree is similar to a classification tree, however now the output is a numeric or continuous type variable that takes on many different values. In the classification tree example, the focus in this class was predicting if a case belonged to one of two classes. In this case, the regression tree will predict the numeric variable with many potential values rather than just two.\n",
    "\n",
    " The syntax for fitting a regression tree is very similar in R compared to the classification tree. The same function, `rpart()` is used and the function `rpart.plot()` will be used to visualize the fitted regression tree similar to before. The primary argument to the `rpart()` function is a formula where the left-hand side is the attribute of interest and the right hand side contains attributes that help predict the outcome. In the example below, the log of salary is the outcome and the number of home runs hit during the previous season is used as the sole continuous attribute used to predict the log of the salary. The data argument is also specified and the only difference here between a classification tree and the regression tree here is the `method` argument. In the regression tree the method argument should be set to `method = 'anova'`. This tells the `rpart()` function that the outcome is numeric and that an anova method should be used in the model fitting. The anova stands for Analysis of Variance and we will discuss this in more detail moving forward."
