    " Before, linear regression has been ran with a continuous attribute. In both models, the baby's birth weight was the outcome of interest and the predictor in one model was the number of gestational days and in the other was the age of the mother at time of birth. What happens when a categorical predictor is used instead of a continuous predictor? This section will introduce that idea with a categorical predictor that has two different levels.\n",

First, let's explore the distribution and calculate descriptive statistics for birth weight across the two groups."
