Data visualization is often a first way to see if there are extreme data values, how much variation there is in the data, and where typical values lie in the distribution. In this section of the course, we plan to explore the following related to distributions:\n"," 1.

The R function to read in the data is `read_csv()`. Function arguments are passed within the parentheses and for the `read_csv()` function the first argument is the path to the data. The data for this example are posted on GitHub in a comma separated file. This means the data is stored in a text format and each variable (i.e. column in the data) is separated by a comma. This is a common format data is stored.\n","\n","  The data is stored to an object named `college_score`. In R (and other statistical programming languages), it is common to use objects to store results to use later. In this instance, we would like to read in the data and store it to use it later. For example, we will likely want to explore the data visually to see if we can extract some trends from the data. The assignment to an object in R is done with the `<-` assignment operator. Finally, there is one additional argument, `guess_max` which helps to ensure that the data are read in appropriately. More on this later."],"metadata":{}},{"source":["college_score <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lebebr01/statthink/master/data-raw/College-scorecard-4143.csv\", guess_max = 10000)\n",""],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  ### View the Data\n","\n","  The `head()` function is R is useful to get a quick snapshot of the data to ensure that is has been read in appropriately."],"metadata":{}},{"source":["head(college_score)\n",""],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ## Univariate Distributions\n","\n","  Univariate distributions mean exploring the data for a single variable by itself. This can be useful as an initial exploration of the data to understand information about which values are typical, if there are any extreme values, what the range of the variable has, and other characteristics. Univariate distributions are useful, however in most data situations, these form the initial exploration only and multivariate thinking is needed, which we will explore next.\n","\n"," Using the college scorecard data, suppose we were interested in exploring the admission rate of higher education institutions to prioritize which institutions would be appropriate to apply to. One figure that is useful initially in this regard is the histrogram. A histogram can be created with the `ggformula` R package using the `gf_histrogram()` function. This function needs two arguments, the first is an equation that identifies the variables to be plotted and the second is the data using the format `data = ...` where the `...` is the name of the data object. Below is an example of the code used to create a histrogram."],"metadata":{}},{"source":["gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score)\n",""],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n"," The equation argument above with the `ggformula` package takes the following general structure:\n"," `y-axis ~ x-axis`\n"," where the variable identified to the left of the `~` is the variable defined on the y-axis and the variable to the right of the `~` is the variable to be placed on the x-axis. If a variable is not specified (as is the case here) on one side of the equation, that axis is ignored. This is most commonly done when exploring univariate distributions where only a single variable is to be plotted.\n","\n"," ### Interpretting Histograms\n","\n"," Histograms are created by collapsing the data into bins and the number of data points that fall in the range of the bin are counted. To show this more clearly in the figure created previously, we can add some color to show the different bins with the arguments, `color = 'black'`."],"metadata":{}},{"source":["gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black')\n",""],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" As you can see, now the different bins are able to be seen more easily.\n","\n"," ### Adjusting Number of Bins\n","\n"," When creating histograms, the figure depends on where the boundaries of the bins can be found. It is often useful to change the number of bins to explore the impact these may have. This can be done two ways with the `gf_histogram()` function, either through the `bins` or `binwidth` arguments. The `bins` argument allows the user to specify the number of bins and the `bindwidth` argument allows the user to specify how wide the bins should be and the number of bins are calculated based on the bin size and the range of the data.
