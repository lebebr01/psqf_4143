More specifically, the data are essentially split into subgroups and the median is computed for each of those subgroups instead of pooling all institutions into a single data frame. The formula syntax is now `outcome ~ grouping` where the variable of interest (i.e. commonly a numeric variable) and the variable to the right of the `~` is the grouping variable. This syntax is similar to the violin plots that were created earlier.\n","\n","   Can you see differences in the admission rates across the regions?\n","\n","   One thing that is useful to add in when computing conditional statisics, is how many data points are in each group. This is particularly useful when the groups are different sizes, which is common.

The median attempts to provide a single number summary for the center of the distribution. It is a robust statistic, but likely isn't the most popular statistic to provide a location for the center of a distribution. The mean is often more commonly used as a measure of the center of a distribution. Part of this is due to the usage of the mean in common statistical methods and the mean also uses the values of all the data in the calculation. The median only considers the values of the middle score or scores, therefore this statistic is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean. I like to look at both statistics and this can provide some insight into the distribution of interest. We can add the mean using the `df_stats()` function by adding the function `mean`."],"metadata":{}},{"source":["stats_compute <- college_score %>%\n","  df_stats(adm_rate ~ region, median, mean, length)\n","stats_compute\n",""],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["   Do you notice any trends in the direction the mean and median typically follow?
