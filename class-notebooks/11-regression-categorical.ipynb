These programs have become popular in larger metros and allow individuals to rent a bike for a short period of time at specified stations. Users return the bikes to the same station or another station in a different part of the city and are charged per ride based on how long the bike was rented for. The pricing structure for this program can be found here: https://www.niceridemn.com/pricing. The gist of the pricing structure is that users can pay for each individual ride where every 30 minutes of bike renting time costs $2 or you can buy a day pass for unlimited 30 minute rides for 24 hours. There is also an option for locals to buy an annual membership which comes with unlimited 60 minute rides for an entire year. Also, if you are interested, a real time map of the bike stations and bikes that are available can be seen here: https://member.niceridemn.com/map/.\n","\n"," The data was downloaded directly from the Nice Ride website and contain individual trip data for the month of June 2019.
