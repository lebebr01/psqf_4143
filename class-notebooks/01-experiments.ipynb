    " ### Smoking Ban\n",
    "\n",
    " For 6 months between June 2002 and December 2002, Helena Montana implemented a public smoking ban. The ban removed the ability for individuals to smoke in public buildings including bars and restaurants. Helena is a small town that is relatively isolated from other locations and only contains a single hospital, so any health effects are routed to the single hospital in the city. Below is a map showing where Helena is located in Montana. After these 6 months, those opposed to the public smoking ban were able to get the ban removed.\n",

    " Researchers compared the average number of people admitted for heart attacks prior to the public smoking ban, during the public smoking ban, and after the public smoking ban. Researchers found that during the public smoking ban that the average number of patients admitted for heart attacks decreased by 60%. This effect went away after the smoking ban was removed.\n",

    " ### Vietnam War Draft\n",
    "\n",
    " A researcher in 1990, Angrist, evaluated the impact of military service on lifetime earnings. Angrist studied the era associated with the vietnam war. In the vietnam war, a draft was used to select individuals for military service, similar to one conducted during World War II. The draft consisted of a two stage process, first 365 days of the year were entered into a lottery where each day represented a birthday and selected one at a time. The first one drawn was 258, which reflected a birthday of September 14. After these were all selected, a second lottery occured with all 26 letters of the alphabet which represents the first initial of men's name. These were also drawn randomly. More information about the lottery can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969). Note, there is a lot of controversy regarding this lottery and whether it was truly random or not. It was later discovered that the paper slips that contained the 365 days of the year were entered into the glass jar in order of month and were not mixed suitably therefore those with November and December birthdays were more likely to be drafted.\n",

    " Angrist used this random process of lottery selection to explore how military service effects lifetime earnings and found that on average those that served during the vietnam war earned 15% less.\n",

    " ## Random Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    " The key between these two situations is **random assignment** (although those depicted above are natural experiments in which these studies are observational). Random assignment, if done appropriately, helps to equalize other characteristics for the two (or more) groups to provide a more direct comparison of the treatment effect. These are very popular in medicine, but are also found in the social sciences to help establish causal arguments. Without random assignment, or other statisical techniques to equalize groups, the statements about causality can not be made. If random assignment into groups is feasible, then this type of study is often referred to as a *randomized control trial*.\n",

The data for this example are posted on GitHub in a comma separated file. This means the data is stored in a text format and each variable (i.e. column in the data) is separated by a comma. This is a common format data is stored.\n",

In this instance, we would like to read in the data and store it to use it later. For example, we will likely want to explore the data visually to see if we can extract some trends from the data. The assignment to an object in R is done with the `<-` assignment operator. Finally, there is one additional argument, `guess_max` which helps to ensure that the data are read in appropriately. More on this later."
